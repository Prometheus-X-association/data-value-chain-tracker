# Data Value Chain Tracker BB Design Document

The Data Value Chain Tracker (DVCT from now on) building block is a sophisticated system that monitors the direct and indirect use of data and incentivizes data usage. it is based on a set of regulations, contractual requirements, and an immutable and distributed database that together form a robust infrastructure for traceable data exchange. DVCT not only ensures auditability and traceability of data usage but also enables organizations and individuals to see the value of their data

Example of use case, ...

**DVCT objectives**

## Conceptual Overview

### Example

![Example Instance Model](diagrams/dva-concept-instance.png)


## Technical Usage Scenarios & Features

### Features/Main Functionalities

Key functionalities:
1. xxxx
2. xxx
3. xxx

DVCT also potentially enables proving/verifying such properties about the shared data that are related to additional, sensitive (eg due to GDPR) data, without disclosing them (possibly using zero-knowledge proofs).

### Technical Usage Scenarios

With DVCT, data exchange participants can be assured that the data fulfils predefined quality requirements.

#### Management of Veracity Level Agreements

#### Proving & Attestation of Veracity

<!-- TODO -->

#### Logging of Results

## Requirements

* **`[BB_06__01]`** DVCT MUST define schemata for xxx
* **`[BB_06__02]`** DVCT MUST support xx
* **`[BB_06__03]`** DVCT MUST provide xx
* **`[BB_06__03]`** DVCT MUST support xx
* **`[BB_06__04]`** DVCT SHOULD support xx
* **`[BB_06__05]`** DVCT SHOULD support xx
* **`[BB_06__06]`** DVCT SHOULD support xx
* **`[BB_06__07]`** DVCT SHOULD support xx
* **`[BB_06__08]`** DVCT SHOULD interface with the Distributed data visualization Building block
* **`[BB_06__09]`** DVCT SHOULD interface with the Connector


## Integrations

### Direct Integrations with Other BBs

_No direct integrations identified as of yet._


### Integrations via Connector

* DVCT will likely have to directly integrate with the **Connector** itself to extend data exchange flows with veracity assurance steps
* As veracity level agreements are similar to contracts (or will become part of the contracts), DVCT will have interactions with the **Contract** component
* Potential integrations with **Consent** as well (?)
* The _point_ is strongly related to data usage
